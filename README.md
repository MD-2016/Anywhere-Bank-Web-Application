# Anywhere-Bank-Web-Application
A web based banking application that allows users to make an account and keep track of their money.
The company Anywhere Bank is a fictional company and the name was chosen by my team (HTML authors metadata tag). The purpose of this app was to focus on the security aspect of handling personal data. We had to develop business documentation to support our app in the case of horrible events (fires, hacking attacks, etc). This app is meant to just be used a small scale money tracking app.
